        <h3> Short Documentary Film </h3>
        <p> At the beginning of the semester, my classmates and I were tasked with finding a subject for our own documentary. It had to surround a social issue that we feel isn't getting enough attention on or around campus. My partner Yulynn and I chose to highlight the professors' union at Fordham Univeristy -- Fordham Faculty United. This short film highlights a few passionate part-time professors as well as the chief steward for the union at Fordham's Lincoln Center campus. The union has been bargaining with the university for over 20 sessions. This film highlights the need for the union and how poorly they are treated by Fordham administration.</p>

        <h3> Photography </h3>    
        <p> In addition to the video filming and editing portion of the course, I was tasked with taking photos of my documentary subjects as well as production photos. A few are highlighted below. All photographs were taken on a Nikon DSLR camera and editing was completed using Adobe Photoshop. </p>
