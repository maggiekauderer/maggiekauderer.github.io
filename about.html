        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Hi there, I'm Maggie! Here's a little bit more about me. - I'm a senior at Fordham's Gabelli School of Business majoring in Business Administration with concentrations in Marketing and Strategic Branding, and minoring in Digital Technologies and Emerging Media, with a 3.8 GPA. I am originally from California but came to NYC to expand my horizons in one of the worlds most culturally influential hubs. <br/> <br/> This semester, I had the opportunitiy in my Digital Production and New Media class to create a short documentary film highlighting an issue at Fordham. I thoroughly enjoyed my time creating meaningful media.           
            On campus, I am committed to improving the Fordham academic and social experience through my involvement with the Gabelli School of Business Dean’s Council and Freshman Advising Program. My position as the Marketing Committee chair on the GSB Dean’s Council has me running social media campaigns to gain student feedback and creating marketing materials to promote administrative events and local Bronx businesses. I also served as the co-chair for the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee for the business school Freshman Advising Mentors. We piloted exciting initiatives last semester to engage 1st year students in the DEI sphere.
            <br/> <br/> A fun fact about me is that my wardrobe is 75% thrifted. I love finding someone’s lost treasures and making them my own! </p>
